        <h3>Policy overview</h3>
             <p>
                FedEx Corporation (together with its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, “FedEx”) recognizes the importance of having effective privacy protections in place and is committed to compliance with applicable data privacy laws, regulations, internal policies and standards. These protections form the foundation of a trustworthy company, are necessary to maintain the confidence of customers and employees and ensure the company’s own compliance with such local laws. This Global Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is based on globally accepted, basic principles on data protection.
             </p>

        <h3>Scope</h3>             
             <p>This Policy applies worldwide to all employees and companies of FedEx. Individual operating companies may not adopt policies inconsistent with this Policy. Supplemental data Protection requirements for individual operating companies, regions or countries may be created with the approval of the Global Chief Compliance and Governance Officer (“GCCGO”).</p>

        <h3>Application of Local Laws</h3>      
              
            <p>Each operating company of FedEx is responsible for compliance with this Policy. If there is reason to believe that local law requirements or other legal obligations contradict the duties under this Policy, the relevant operating company must inform the GCCGO. In the event of conflicts between applicable local laws, rules or regulations and the Policy, FedEx will work to find a practical solution that reconciles these requirements.</p>
